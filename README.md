# CSS Toggler

Allows for more quick css functionality.
Including:
- Enabling and Disabling the snippet without removing it from the tab
- Deleting the snippets via the message or command
- Naming snippets
- Sort the snippets by time of applying, alphabetically, or person
- Add own snippets.
- Add button to other messages as well (any message with a css block in it)

### To-Do
- If message is updated, update snippet as well
- Add edit functionality directly to snippet

# Format
There is a certain format that we do require for snippets to have in Quick CSS. It is the same format that is found when clicking the `add snippet` button in #css-snippets. An example of this format is as follows. There is an example as well.
```
/**
 * Snippet from *channel (#css-snippets)* applied the *timestamp (Oct 27, 2021 at 10:10:44 PM)*
